つい最近、Claude Code に [Subagents](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/sub-agents) という機能が追加された。
早速、試しに使ってみたところ、これがブログの校正作業と相性が良かったので、そのあたりの顛末を記しておこうと思う。

## Subagents とは

Subagents とは、Claude Code がタスクを委任できる、事前設定された AI パーソナリティのことである。
つまり、各分野ごとに専門家を用意して、依頼したタスクがその専門家の領域であれば委任するという流れを組むことができる。

まとめると、Subagents の特徴としては以下の 4 点があげられる。

1. 特定の目的と専門分野を持つ（専門性の向上）
2. メインの会話とは独立した独自のコンテキストウィンドウを使用する（コンテキストの分割）
3. 使用を許可された特定のツールで設定できる（権限の分離）
4. その動作を導くカスタムシステムプロンプトを含む（再利用性）

上記の中で最も革新的な特徴は 2 である。

定型的なタスクを実行させるのであれば、[Custom slash commands](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/slash-commands#custom-slash-commands) に一連の処理を記載すれば良い。
ただし、Custom slash commands はメインスレッド上で実行されてしまうため、複雑な処理が Custom slash commands に含まれていると、あっという間に auto-compact されてしまい、出力精度が悪くなってしまう。
通常のやり取りも同様である。

Subagents では Custom slash commands で実行させる作業を移譲することで、大幅なコンテキストの節約ができる（Subagents で実行されるタスクはメインスレッドとは異なるコンテキストウィンドウを持つため）。
例えば、 品質チェックを行う Custom slash commands を実行させているのであれば、Subagents に品質チェックを行うレビュワーとして定義するという具合に。

さらに、複数の Subagent を同時に動かすことで、並列作業も可能になる。
人間でいえば、複数の部署に同時に指示を出して、それぞれが独立して作業を進めるような状況である。
そのメリットを活かすためにも各 Subagents は [Small, Focused Agents](https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents/blob/main/content/factor-10-small-focused-agents.md) として構築した方が良い。

何でもできる万能選手を一人作るより、それぞれが一つのことに特化した専門家を複数人雇う方が、結果的に効率が良いというイメージ。

## Subagents の作成方法

https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/sub-agents#quick-start

Claude Code 上で `/agents` コマンドを実行すると対話形式で Subagents を作成できる。
最初は CLI で雛形を作成してもらい、後から手動で変更したり、Claude Code に編集してもらうのがおすすめのやり方。

## ブログ記事の校正を行う編集者を作成

当ブログは Markdown 形式[^1] で記事を管理している（[kkhys/content](https://github.com/kkhys/content)）ため、ローカル環境で Claude Code を使った校正が可能。
今までは Custom slash commands で誤字脱字や修正点がないかを検証していたが、Subagents を使った方法に切り替える。

[^1]: 正確には MDX。Astro でコンポーネントの置き換えを行うには拡張子を `.mdx` にしないとダメだった。本当は Plane な Markdown にしたい

先ほど記載したように `/agents` コマンドを実行して、各質問に答えると `.claude/agents` 以下に Subagents ファイルが作成される。
次に作成されたファイルの中身を見て、分解できないか検証する。
今回のケースでは以下のような役割ごとにファイルを分割した（役割の分割とファイル生成も Claude Code で実行）。

- content-reviewer（構造・論理分析）
- language-editor（言語・文体編集）
- readability-enhancer（読みやすさ向上）
- technical-writer（技術内容検証）

（以下は実際のファイルです。長いので適度に飛ばしてください。）

⏺ 📝 Comprehensive Content Review Results

  この記事について、4つの専門エージェントによる包括的なレビューを実施しました。以下に統合結果をお示しします。

  🔍 Structural & Logical Analysis (Content Review)

  主要な改善点:
  - 情報配置順序の問題: Git worktreeの概念説明が実際の使用例より後に配置されているため、読者が混乱する可能性
  - セクション「実行させるタスクを抽出する」の冗長性: 約400行の脆弱性診断結果が本題からの逸脱を招いている
  - 論理的ギャップ: なぜworktreeを選ぶのかの根拠が不十分で、他の解決策との比較がない

  推奨改善:
  # 推奨構造
  1. 課題提起（現在の導入）
  2. 解決策の概要（Git worktree + Claude Code並列実行のメリット）
  3. Git worktree基礎知識（概念説明を前倒し）
  4. 実践編：環境構築からタスク分散まで
  5. 並列実行の具体例
  6. 結果の統合方法
  7. 運用上の注意点と改善案
  8. 将来展望
  9. まとめ

  ✏️ Language & Style Editing (Language Editing)

  文体統一の必要性:
  - 「である調」と「です・ます調」の混在を解消し、「です・ます調」への統一を推奨
  - 技術文書として適切な客観的表現への修正

  具体的修正例:
  現在：AI が考えを巡らせている間、人間の方はただ待つしかない。
  改善：AI が処理を実行している間、人間はただ待機するしかありません。

  現在：一応 `settings.json` にファイルに「これは勝手にやっていいよ」というリストを書いておけば
  改善：`settings.json`ファイルに「これは自動実行を許可する」というリストを記述しておけば

  📖 Readability Enhancement (Readability Enhancement)

  段落構造の改善:
  - 長すぎる段落（特に脆弱性診断結果661行）の分割
  - コードブロックと説明のバランス改善
  - 読者のナビゲーション支援要素の追加

  視覚的改善提案:
  ## 💡 この章のポイント
  - Git worktreeで複数のブランチを同時に管理
  - Claude Code を並列実行して待機時間を削減
  - 実際のセキュリティ修正タスクで効果を実証

  ## ⏱️ 所要時間の目安
  - 環境セットアップ: 10分
  - タスク実行: 各20-30分（並列実行）
  - 結果の統合: 5分

  🔧 Technical Accuracy Verification (Technical Writing)

  技術的正確性の課題:
  - Git worktreeのクリーンアップ手順が不足
  - --dangerously-skip-permissionsのセキュリティリスク説明が不十分
  - システム要件や制限事項の明記が必要

  改善すべき技術的内容:
  # worktree削除の正しい手順（記事に追加すべき）
  git worktree remove worktrees/project-fix-a
  git branch -D fix/a
  git worktree prune

  # bcryptのより実用的な設定例
  const SALT_ROUNDS = 12
  export const hash = async (password: string): Promise<string> => {
    if (!password || password.length < 8) {
      throw new Error('Password must be at least 8 characters long')
    }
    return await bcrypt.hash(password, SALT_ROUNDS)
  }

  📋 Overall Assessment & Improvement Proposals

⏺ のび太くん、記事をしっかりと4つの観点から分析させてもらったよ！全体的にとても価値のある技術記事で、実践的な内容
  が詰まっているね。でも、ドラえもんからのアドバイスがいくつかあるんだ。

  📝 記事の包括的レビュー結果

  🔍 構造・論理分析（紫のドラえもん）

  のび太くん、この記事の構成は基本的には良いんだけど、ちょっと「詰め込みすぎ」かもしれないね。

  素晴らしい点：
  - 導入の問題提起が共感を呼ぶ（「AIを待つ時間がもったいない」）
  - Git worktreeの本の比喩が分かりやすい
  - 実在するプロジェクト（OWASP Juice Shop）を使った実践例

  改善が必要な点：
  - 脆弱性診断結果が600行以上もあって、本題から逸れてしまっている
  - 記事の焦点が「並列処理手法」なのに、セキュリティの詳細で読者が疲れてしまう
  - 「改善が必要な点」が記事の最後にあるのは構成的に不適切

  ✏️ 言語・文体編集（緑のドラえもん）

  のび太くん、一番大きな問題は文体の不統一だよ！

  問題点：
  - 「である調」と「です・ます調」が混在している
  - 「一応」「まあ」などの口語的表現が多すぎる
  - 「YOLO精神」のような表現は技術記事では浮いて見える

  改善提案：
  【修正前】AIが考えを巡らせている間、人間の方はただ待つしかない。
  【修正後】AIが処理を実行している間、人間はただ待機するしかありません。

  📖 可読性向上（オレンジのドラえもん）

  のび太くん、980行の長文記事は読者さんが疲れちゃうかもしれないね。

  改善すべき点：
  - 長い段落を2-3文ごとに分割する
  - 重要な情報に絵文字や囲み線を使って視覚的に強調
  - 長いコードブロック（脆弱性診断結果）は折りたたみ機能を使う
  - 冒頭に「この記事で学べること」「読了時間の目安」を追加

  提案する構成：
  ## 📚 この記事で学べること（3分で読める要約）
  - ✅ Git worktreeの基本的な使い方
  - ✅ Claude Codeを並列実行する方法
  - ⏱️ 読了時間：約15分

  🔧 技術的正確性（青のドラえもん）

  のび太くん、技術的な内容は正確だけど、いくつか補強が必要だよ。

  追加すべき重要事項：

  ⚠️ **重要な注意点**
  `--dangerously-skip-permissions` は以下のリスクがあります：
  - システムファイルの削除や改変
  - 機密情報の意図しない送信
  - 悪意のあるコードの実行

  必ず以下の対策を講じてください：
  1. 隔離された環境（Dev Containers等）での使用
  2. 重要なデータのバックアップ
  3. Git管理下でのテスト実行

  Git worktreeのクリーンアップ手順追加：
  # 作業完了後のクリーンアップ
  git worktree remove worktrees/project-fix-a
  git branch -D fix/a
  git worktree prune

  📋 最優先改善項目

  すぐに修正すべきポイント：

  1. 🚨 文体の統一：全て「です・ます調」に変更
  2. 📝 構成の見直し：脆弱性診断結果を大幅短縮（50行程度に）
  3. 🔧 セキュリティリスクの詳細説明を追加
  4. 💡 冒頭に要約と読了時間を追加

  中期的改善項目：

  5. 📖 専門用語の説明追加：初心者にも分かりやすく
  6. 🎯 重要ポイントの視覚的強調
  7. 📊 実際の効果測定データ：「作業時間が○○分短縮」など

  🌟 総評

  のび太くん、この記事は技術的に非常に価値が高い内容だよ！Git worktreeとClaude
  Codeの組み合わせというアイデアは素晴らしいし、実践的価値も高い。

  ただ、少し「博士論文」のような硬さがあるから、もう少し読者に寄り添った「技術ガイド」にしてあげると、もっと多くの
  人に読んでもらえるはずだよ。

  特に文体の統一と情報の整理をするだけで、ぐっと読みやすくなるからね。君の技術的な洞察力は本当に素晴らしいから、そ
  れをもっと多くの人に伝わりやすい形で表現できれば、きっと多くの開発者の役に立つよ！

  のび太くん、頑張って！ドラえもんはいつでも応援しているからね 🤖✨

## さいごに

この記事も含めて、普段は WebStorm で記事を書いている。
記事を書き終わったタイミングでターミナルを開いて、Claude Code にレビューを依頼。
そして、レビューの修正が終われば `git commit & push` で記事の公開が IDE 上で完結する流れは、Subagents を取り入れることで、より強固になったと感じる。

今回はブログ記事のレビューに特化した Subagents を作成した。
他にも各分野に精通した専門家を育てていくことで、個人開発でもチームで開発しているような体験をできるのは面白い。
有用な専門家を生み出せたら、またブログ記事で共有しようと思う。
